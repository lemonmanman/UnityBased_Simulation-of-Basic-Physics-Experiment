# UnityBased_Simulation-of-Basic-Physics-Experiment

We aim to build a simulation platform of basic physics experiments, based on Unity. The project is designed to better assist previewing the experiments before hands-on operation. (The Unity skills are all learned by myself, so the repository is also used as a reminder of my learning process.)

## Why is the Project Built

### About us
We are undergraduates majored in **Robotics**, so Basic Physics Experiments is one of our compulsory courses.
### About the course: Basic Physics Experiments
This is only a one-credit course, yet it takes us far more time than a one-credit course would require to complete the basic tasks. And the process that consumes the most time is the previewing task: **we spend more than 2 hours per experiment to copy the preview report on paper, while learning** `almost nothing important` **about the experiment itself**. As a result, when student begin to do the hands-on operation, they become overwhelmed. This is also the problem the physics teachers are facing , that is `separation between theory and practice`.
### About the preview task
Apparently, simply setting the preview task by copying preview task does little help to both the understanding of the physics law of the experiment and the hands-on operation skills. So we seek to build up a simulation platform, which:
- Helps students to preview the experiments with the help of dynamic schematic diagrams, introductions combined with real instrument components and free operations. 
- Provides teachers with powers to check out students preview operations online, so that during the hands-on operation, they can focus on the operations where students make the most mistakes.

## What Can You Find in the Project
### Our progress
We will present our codes in the repository. Videos will also be posted to vividly demonstrate our results.
### We are also rookies
As nobody teach us about unity, the project is built while we are studying about the skills at the same time. So you will probably see quite a few basic unity skills, which we record in case we forget about it.(STUPID BUT USEFUL)
### Things would be added gradually~
