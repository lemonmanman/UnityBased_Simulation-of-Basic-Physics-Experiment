# UnityBased_Simulation-of-Basic-Physics-Experiment
We aim to build a simulation platform of basic physics experiments, based on Unity. The project is designed to better assit previewing the experiments before hands on operation. (The Unity skills are all learned by myself, so the repository is also used as a reminder of my learning process.
